                            Hollywood has long been a town where magic happens. Actors and actresses have rocketed to stardom. Major studios have produced some of the most celebrated motion pictures in cinematic history. Ornate movie palaces have been built, and more than a century later, some still stand. A 1923 real estate advertisement—the Hollywood Sign—has become one of California’s most famous landmarks.
